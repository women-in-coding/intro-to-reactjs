# Intro to ReactJS

Welcome! This repo contains the source code for the slide deck we will use during the class, and is also where we will publish the code examples that we will create along the way.

## Running the slide deck

_Note: we will also post a link to a pdf version of the deck after the first class, so don't worry if this sounds a little complicated._

Make sure you have `bower` and `http-server` installed globally:

``` bash
npm install -g bower http-server
```

Clone the repo, and navigate to the `deck/` directory:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/women-in-coding/intro-to-reactjs.git
cd intro-to-reactjs/deck
```

Install the dependencies:

``` bash
bower install
```

Run the server:

``` bash
http-server
```

Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`
